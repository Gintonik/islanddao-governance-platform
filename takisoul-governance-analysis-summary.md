# Takisoul Governance Power Analysis Summary

## Issue Overview
Takisoul's governance power calculation shows 9,017,888 ISLAND in my calculator vs the expected ~8,700,000 ISLAND from realms.today canonical data.

## Time Decay Analysis
- **Reported 3-4 days ago:** ~8.7M ISLAND with 1.35x multiplier for large deposit
- **Expected today:** Should be lower due to lockup time decay
- **Calculator shows:** 9.01M ISLAND (still inflated, not decreasing)

## Current Calculator Results
```
Deposit 1: 1,500,000 ISLAND × 1.102x = 1,653,000 power (15 days remaining)
Deposit 2: 2,000,000 ISLAND × 1.296x = 2,592,000 power (39 days remaining)  
Deposit 3: 3,682,784 ISLAND × 1.296x = 4,772,888 power (39 days remaining)
Total: 9,017,888 ISLAND
```

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Metadata Conflicts
- Both deposits 2 and 3 show identical lockup metadata (ending 2025-07-13)
- This suggests the calculator is reading from the same metadata source incorrectly
- Deposits should have different lockup periods and multipliers

### 2. Missing Time Decay
- Governance power should decrease daily as lockup periods expire
- Calculator shows static values that don't account for time passage
- No evidence of the expected multiplier decay over 3-4 days

### 3. Inflated Multipliers
- Calculator shows 1.296x for large deposit
- realms.today showed 1.35x several days ago (should be lower now)
- Multipliers appear to be from incorrect metadata sources

## Root Cause Analysis
The VSR calculator is using conflicting lockup metadata that produces:
1. **Higher multipliers** than canonical calculation
2. **Identical metadata** for different deposits
3. **No time decay** as lockup periods expire

## Attempted Fixes
1. **Universal metadata validation** - No improvement
2. **Conservative metadata selection** - Too aggressive, broke other calculations
3. **Targeted complex account handling** - No change in results

## Current Status
- **Phantom deposit filtering**: ✅ Working correctly (GintoniK shows 4.24M)
- **Standard VSR calculations**: ✅ Working for most citizens
- **Complex VSR accounts**: ❌ Takisoul still shows inflated values
- **Time decay compliance**: ❌ Values not decreasing over time

## Technical Findings
1. Calculator finds 3 VSR accounts for Takisoul but only 1 contains deposits
2. Metadata scan failed to find alternative sources producing 1.35x multiplier
3. Conservative approaches eliminate too many valid deposits

## Recommendations
1. **Investigate canonical VSR program logic** - Compare with official implementation
2. **Time-based validation** - Ensure multipliers decrease as expected daily
3. **Metadata source verification** - Find correct offsets that match realms.today
4. **Account-specific handling** - Implement targeted fixes for complex cases

## Data Integrity Status
- Using only authentic blockchain data from Solana mainnet
- No mock or synthetic values in calculations
- All results derived from actual VSR account state
- Phantom deposit filtering prevents false positive data

## Next Steps Required
1. Deep investigation of VSR program's canonical multiplier calculation
2. Implementation of time-decay aware metadata validation
3. Verification against realms.today's current values (should be lower than 8.7M now)
4. Testing with other complex VSR accounts to ensure fix doesn't break others
