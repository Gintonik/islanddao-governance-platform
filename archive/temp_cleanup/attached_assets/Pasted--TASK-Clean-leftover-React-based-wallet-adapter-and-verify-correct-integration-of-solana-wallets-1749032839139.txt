ðŸ’¡ TASK: Clean leftover React-based wallet adapter and verify correct integration of `solana-wallets-universal`

I suspect that the app still contains broken or conflicting parts from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. Please go through this checklist step-by-step:

---

âœ… 1. SEARCH FOR REACT-BASED ADAPTERS

Search the codebase for any lines that import:

- @solana/wallet-adapter-react
- @solana/wallet-adapter-base
- @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
- WalletProvider, ConnectionProvider, WalletModalProvider

ðŸ§¹ Delete or comment out all lines and files that use these. They are React-only and conflict with solana-wallets-universal.

---

âœ… 2. SEARCH FOR DUPLICATE WALLET CONNECTION LOGIC

In all files (HTML and JS), search for:

- window.solana.connect(...)
- new PhantomWalletAdapter()
- old wallet connect code

ðŸ§¹ Only allow one instance: `createWalletAdapter()` from `@jup-ag/solana-wallets`.

---

âœ… 3. CHECK FOR REACT STYLING CONFLICTS

Remove this line if found:

```js
import '@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css';

Also check for legacy adapter UIs loaded via script tags or global CSS that may be breaking modal styles.

âœ… 4. VERIFY MODAL & DOM STATE

In the browser console, check:

Are there multiple modals?

Are some modals blank or styled incorrectly?

Are <img> tags for NFTs broken (404s or missing sources)?

Inspect DOM and clean duplicate or malformed wallet modal code.

âœ… 5. CLEAN STALE CSS OR JSX FILES

Check if files like App.jsx or WalletProvider.jsx still exist but arenâ€™t in use. Delete them if they were only used for the old React wallet adapter.

âœ… 6. VERIFY THAT ONLY ONE CONNECTOR IS ACTIVE

Ensure the only active wallet connection method is:

import { createWalletAdapter } from '@jup-ag/solana-wallets';

Confirm this is initialized correctly in a single place, and publicKey/signMessage functions work after connection.

After cleanup is complete, confirm:

Wallet modal opens cleanly

Wallets connect without console errors

NFT images load properly

signMessage() works when tested from console
