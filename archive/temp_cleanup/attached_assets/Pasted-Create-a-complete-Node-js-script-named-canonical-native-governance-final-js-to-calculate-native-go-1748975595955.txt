Create a complete Node.js script named `canonical-native-governance-final.js` to calculate native governance power from the Solana blockchain using the Voter Stake Registry (VSR) program.

🧠 GOAL:
Match the **verified historical target values** of native governance power for IslandDAO citizens by scanning and parsing **all ~16,586 VSR accounts** using **manual Anchor-compatible deserialization**, **authority alias resolution**, and **per-deposit lockup-based multipliers**.

---

🔁 STEP 1: Fetch all VSR accounts (NO filters)

Use this method to get ALL accounts:
```ts
const accounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(
  new PublicKey("vsr2nfGVNHmSY8uxoBGqq8AQbwz3JwaEaHqGbsTPXqQ"),
  { commitment: "confirmed" }
);
⛔ Do NOT use .all() or filters. We need raw accounts to parse manually.

🔍 STEP 2: Manually parse each account

For each account:

Deserialize using the vsr-idl.json Anchor IDL (already exists in root)

Extract the voter object

Loop through voter.depositEntries[]

📏 STEP 3: For each deposit entry:

Read and calculate governance power using:
votingPower = amount * multiplier
Where:

amount = depositEntry.amountDepositedNative

multiplier = min(5, 1 + min((lockupEndTs - now) / 31_556_952, 4))

Use the lockup.endTs field

Use current Unix timestamp for now

🚫 Ignore expired lockups (if endTs < now)
✅ Phantom deposit filtering: ignore deposits with amount === 1000 AND empty config

🔗 STEP 4: Authority Matching

Use wallet_aliases_expanded.json to map each citizen wallet to:

walletAddress

authority

voterAuthority

any known alias (controlled wallet, delegated authority)

Each matched VSR account must belong to or be controlled by a citizen wallet.

🧮 STEP 5: Aggregate Results

For each target wallet, output:

🎯 TARGET VALUES TO MATCH:

Takisoul: 8,709,019.78 ISLAND

GJdRQcsy: 144,708.98 ISLAND

Whale's Friend: 12,625.58 ISLAND

If these values match exactly, lock the scanner and mark the code as canonical.

📦 Save output to native-results-verified.json

🛑 Absolutely do NOT:

Use .all() from Anchor

Use filtered dataSize queries

Apply global multipliers across multiple deposits

Skip alias-based VSR account discovery

♻️ This prompt is the final recovery path for the IslandDAO native governance power scanner. If results match verified targets, lock this code as canonical and never touch the logic again.

### ✅ This Prompt Recovers:

- Takisoul’s full 8.7M+ across **multiple lockups**
- Whale’s Friend’s exact 12,625.58 (with no active lockups)
- GJdRQcsy’s 144k across **4 lockups with multipliers**
