Fix the canonical VSR governance power scanner to use the correct canonical rules below. The goal is to calculate native and delegated governance power using only on-chain data, without any inference or fallback assumptions. DO NOT misclassify native as delegated or vice versa.

Use these verified ground-truth test cases to validate and correct the scanner:

1. Wallet: kruHL3zJ1Mcbdibsna5xM6yMp7PZZ4BsNTpj2UMgvZC
   - Deposits:
     - 310,472.9693 ISLAND
     - 126,344.82227 ISLAND
   - All locked in VSR with voting multipliers
   - ‚úÖ Expected:
     - Native Governance Power: ‚û°Ô∏è Use multiplier-based calculation
     - Delegated Power: **0**
     - DO NOT assume delegated power. There is none.
     - DO NOT default to VWR total.

2. Wallet: 3PKhzE9wuEkGPHHu2sNCvG86xNtDJduAcyBPXpE6cSNt
   - Deposits: ~10.35M ISLAND
   - ‚úÖ Expected:
     - Native Power: ~10.35M ISLAND
     - Delegated Power: ~1,268,162 ISLAND (delegation exists)
     - Total: ~11.62M ISLAND

3. Wallet: Fywb7YDCXxtD7pNKThJ36CAtVe23dEeEPf7HqKzJs1VG
   - ‚úÖ Expected:
     - Native Power: ~3.36M ISLAND
     - Delegated Power: ~1.6M ISLAND

4. Wallet: 4pT6ESaMQTgpMs2ZZ81pFF8BieGtY9x4CCK2z6aoYoe4
   - ‚úÖ Expected:
     - Native Power: ~13,625.581 ISLAND
     - Delegated Power: ~4,189,328.11 ISLAND
     - Delegator: CinHb6Xt2PnqKUkmhRo9hwUkixCcsH1uviuQqaTxwT9i

üëâ Ensure:
- Voter accounts where `authority === wallet` are counted as native.
- Voter accounts where `voterAuthority === wallet` and `authority !== wallet` are delegated.
- Parse deposits properly using Anchor-compatible struct parsing (e.g., offset 104 + 87*i), and use correct isUsed detection (handle values like 131).
- Apply the correct lockup multipliers per IslandDAO config (e.g., cliff, constant, vesting).
- Do not fall back to VWR if native deposits are present.
- Do not infer delegated power if none is found via Voter account scan.

Fix any deposit parsing, lockup detection, or delegation map logic that causes discrepancies against the known values above.

Run a fresh scan and validate all wallets using ONLY authentic on-chain data.
