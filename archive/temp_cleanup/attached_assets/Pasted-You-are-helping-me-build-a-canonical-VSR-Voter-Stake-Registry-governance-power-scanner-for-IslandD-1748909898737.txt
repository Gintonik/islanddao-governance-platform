You are helping me build a canonical VSR (Voter Stake Registry) governance power scanner for IslandDAO on Solana. The goal is to calculate **native**, **delegated**, and **total** governance power for a list of wallets, using only **on-chain data** via Anchor-compatible deserialization ‚Äî no byte-guessing.

üß† Logic Rules:
1. **Native Governance Power** must include *only* tokens from deposits owned by the wallet (i.e., authority === wallet).
2. If a wallet delegates its voting rights, **it still retains native power** ‚Äî it does NOT lose governance power.
3. **Delegated Governance Power** is the sum of tokens **delegated TO** a wallet from other wallets (i.e., it is the voterAuthority on someone else's voter account).
4. Do not show delegated governance for wallets that own the deposits (even if they've delegated them).
5. Governance power = deposit.amount * multiplier (only if the lockup is active/locked).
6. If lockup is expired, exclude it from native governance power.

üß™ VALIDATION TEST CASES (MUST PASS):
- GJdRQcsyz49FMM4LvPqpaM2QA3yWFr8WamJ95hkwCBAh:
  - Native: 144,708.981722 ISLAND (from 4 active lockups with multipliers)
  - Delegated: 0
- Fgv1zrwB6VF3jc45PaNT5t9AnSsJrwb8r7aMNip5fRY1:
  - Native: 200,000 ISLAND
  - Delegated: 0
- 3PKhzE9wuEkGPHHu2sNCvG86xNtDJduAcyBPXpE6cSNt:
  - Native: 10,353,647.013 ISLAND
  - Delegated: 1,268,162 ISLAND
- Fywb7YDCXxtD7pNKThJ36CAtVe23dEeEPf7HqKzJs1VG:
  - Native: 3,361,730.15 ISLAND
  - Delegated: 1,598,919.1 ISLAND
- 4pT6ESaMQTgpMs2ZZ81pFF8BieGtY9x4CCK2z6aoYoe4:
  - Native: 12,625.580931 ISLAND
  - Delegated: should include delegation from CinHb6Xt2PnqKUkmhRo9hwUkixCcsH1uviuQqaTxwT9i (estimated ~4.19M ISLAND)
- 7pPJt2xoEoPy8x8Hf2D6U6oLfNa5uKmHHRwkENVoaxmA:
  - Native: 8,709,019.78 ISLAND (from multiple complex lockups)
- kruHL3zJ1Mcbdibsna5xM6yMp7PZZ4BsNTpj2UMgvZC:
  - Native: 30,999 ISLAND
  - Delegated: 1,337,238 ISLAND

üõ†Ô∏è What You Must Do:
- Use `@coral-xyz/anchor` and the full IDL to deserialize Voter and Registrar accounts.
- Scan all Voter accounts under the IslandDAO VSR program: `vsr2nfGVNHmSY8uxoBGqq8AQbwz3JwaEaHqGbsTPXqQ`
- Use offset **72** to extract `voterAuthority` correctly.
- For each Voter account, if the wallet is `authority`, treat the valid deposits as native.
- For each Voter account, if the wallet is `voterAuthority` (but not authority), add its deposits as delegated to that voterAuthority wallet.
- Always return accurate per-wallet governance power:
  - `nativeGovernancePower`
  - `delegatedGovernancePower`
  - `totalGovernancePower`

Do not change the native power calculation logic, which already works. Only add delegation detection that is safe, verifiable, and respects the wallet authority model.

Final goal: Export a clean JSON and CSV leaderboard that matches all expectations above.
