✅ What’s Working
Canonical VSR program scanning — no hardcoded wallet logic.

Native multiplier application — calculateMultiplier() uses a corrected formula.

Direct offset parsing is clean.

Deposit deduplication via scannedOffsets is in place.

Phantom 1K/11K amounts are correctly filtered.

❌ What’s Failing (Complex Lockups)
Multi-lockup deposits:

For GJdRQcsy..., deposits with multipliers like 1.98x and 2.04x are not matched. Your code reads timestamps.sort((a, b) => a - b) then assigns the first as startTs and last as endTs. That’s oversimplified.

These timestamps are not guaranteed to be in a linear order.

Realms UI appears to extract precise [kind, startTs, endTs] triplets per deposit — not blend them.

Insufficient kind and timestamp validation:

You assume kind is between 1–4 based on a single offset, but Realms may store multiple deposits with different kinds side-by-side.

You need to tie each [amountOffset] to its own kind/startTs/endTs set — currently you're guessing based on nearby bytes.

calculateMultiplier() misalignment:

Your current baseline = 3B and maxExtra = 3B caps max multiplier at 2.0x.

GJdRQcsy’s confirmed multiplier is 2.04x, which means:

Baseline should be 1_000_000_000

Max bonus should be up to 3_000_000_000

You used the old formula. We already confirmed the correct version in your previous working run:

js
Copy
Edit
const BASE = 1_000_000_000;
const MAX_EXTRA = 3_000_000_000;
✅ What You Should Do
1. Fix multiplier logic:
Replace this:

js
Copy
Edit
const baseline = 3_000_000_000;
const maxExtra = 3_000_000_000;
With:

js
Copy
Edit
const BASE = 1_000_000_000;
const MAX_EXTRA = 3_000_000_000;
And update your return logic accordingly.

2. Fix lockup parsing logic (key point):
Instead of trying to group timestamps blindly near offsets, treat each [amountOffset, metadataOffset] as its own pair.

That means:

For offset 264, the metadata is not shared with 344.

You need to read from exact offsets like:

startTs = data.readBigUInt64LE(metadataOffset)

endTs = data.readBigUInt64LE(metadataOffset + 8)

kind = data[metadataOffset + 24]

Each offset has its own triplet.

3. Output verification
Verify that these match within 0.5% of Realms:
