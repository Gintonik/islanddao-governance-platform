You're fixing the native governance power scanner in `fixed-citizen-vsr-scanner.js` for the IslandDAO Citizen Map. Your goal is to finalize canonical, correct calculations using authentic on-chain data with strict ownership filtering. Apply the following steps:

1. âœ… Native Power Filter:
   - Only include VSR accounts where BOTH:
     - `voter_authority === walletPublicKey`
     - `authority === walletPublicKey`
   - This ensures we only count native power (no delegated deposits).
   - Example:
     ```js
     if (
       voterAuthority.equals(walletPublicKey) &&
       authority.equals(walletPublicKey)
     ) {
       // âœ… valid native governance deposit
     } else {
       // ðŸš« skip delegated or misattributed
     }
     ```

2. âœ… Full VSR Account Scan:
   - Scan all program accounts (approx. 6,096) to detect **all** VSR accounts for each wallet.
   - Check `authority` field (offset 8â€“40) to determine ownership.
   - Ensure you're not stopping after the first match â€” aggregate across all accounts owned by the wallet.

3. âœ… Use Working Offset Parser:
   - Reuse the previously working `parseVSRDepositsWithValidation()` function.
   - It uses byte offsets [104, 112, 184, 192, 200, 208] to get:
     - isUsed (flag)
     - amount
     - multiplier
   - For each deposit:
     ```js
     if (isUsed) {
       nativePower += depositAmount * multiplier;
     }
     ```

4. âœ… Manual Validation Benchmarks:
   - Wallet: `4pT6ESaMQTgpMs2ZZ81pFF8BieGtY9x4CCK2z6aoYoe4` (Whale's Friend)
     - Must return exactly `12,625.58` ISLAND native governance power (no more, no less).
     - Any extra (like +1,000 ISLAND) must be filtered as delegated or invalid.
   - Wallet: `7pPJt2xoEoPy8x8Hf2D6U6oLfNa5uKmHHRwkENVoaxmA` (Takisoul)
     - Must detect **all native lockups** totaling ~8.7M ISLAND.
     - Confirm that you're including all VSR accounts owned by this wallet.

5. âœ… Final Output:
   - After confirming all results match expectations, freeze this logic in a new file:
     `canonical-native-scanner.js`
   - This file will never change again â€” it becomes the trusted source of truth.
