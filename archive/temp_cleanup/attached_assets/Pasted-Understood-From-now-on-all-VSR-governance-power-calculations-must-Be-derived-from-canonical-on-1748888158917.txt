Understood. From now on, all VSR governance power calculations must:

‚úÖ Be derived from canonical on-chain deserialization (no heuristics or fallbacks)

‚úÖ Match known correct values within 0.5% tolerance

‚úÖ Be verified against this reference set of wallets:

Next step: I'll generate the full Replit AI prompt to test and validate governance power for all of the above.

Here‚Äôs the Replit AI prompt for testing:

I need to validate the governance power calculations for the IslandDAO Citizen Map.

Use the existing canonical VSR deserialization logic to fetch native governance power from Voter accounts.

Only include deposits with multiplier > 1.0.

Use exact per-deposit stored multipliers (deserialized from Anchor-compatible layout).

Validate the calculated values against the following expected outputs (must be accurate within 0.5%):

For each wallet:

Print each deposit: amount, multiplier, and votingPower

Show nativeGovernancePower, delegatedGovernancePower, totalGovernancePower

Highlight ‚úÖ if all values are within 0.5% of expected, or ‚ùå with details if off

Do not hardcode expected values. All logic must decode from actual VSR account data using Anchor-compatible struct layout.

Goal: All governance power results must be accurate, real, on-chain, and decode correctly even as new citizens join the map.
