You are fixing the canonical native governance power scanner in `canonical-native-scanner.js` for IslandDAO. Your goal is to produce fully accurate native governance power numbers **based solely on authentic VSR on-chain data**, without hardcoding any exceptions.

Do NOT apply any user-specific filters or manual exclusions. Instead:

---

1. ✅ **Comprehensive VSR Account Scanning**:
   - Scan all ~6,096 VSR accounts from the Voter Stake Registry program.
   - For each account:
     - Extract `authority` (offset 8–40)
     - Extract `voter_authority` (offset 72–104)

2. ✅ **Canonical Native Ownership Logic**:
   - For each VSR account:
     - If `authority === walletAddress && voter_authority === walletAddress`, treat as native
     - This avoids counting delegated deposits

3. ✅ **Parse All Deposits (32 max per VSR)**:
   - Use proven offset-based parsing for deposits:
     - Check `isUsed` at offset 104 + (size * i)
     - Parse `amount` at offset 112 + (size * i)
     - Parse `lockup.kind`, `startTs`, `cliffTs`, `endTs` at standard byte positions
   - Only count deposits where `isUsed == true`

4. ✅ **Apply Canonical Multiplier Calculation**:
   - For each deposit:
     - If lockup expired → 1.0x multiplier
     - If still active:
       - Constant lockup: multiplier = now < endTs ? bonus : 1.0
       - Cliff lockup: if now < cliffTs → bonus
       - Vested lockup: always 1.0
   - Multiply amount × multiplier to get governance power

5. ✅ **No Manual Overrides Allowed**:
   - Do NOT hardcode or exclude any wallet or deposit to match known values.
   - Benchmark values like “Whale’s Friend = 12,625.58” and “Takisoul = ~8.7M” must result from real on-chain deposits matching `authority === walletAddress`.

6. ✅ **Validation Examples**:
   - Wallet `3PKhz...` must show power from pure deposited tokens (no lockups, but valid)
   - Wallet `7pPJt2xo...` must include **all VSR accounts** where authority == wallet, not just the first
   - Wallet `4pT6ESaM...` must NOT include the 1,000 ISLAND delegated deposit unless it passes the native ownership filter

7. ✅ **Freeze the Final File**:
   - Once benchmark values are correct without any hardcoded filters, save the implementation as:
     - `canonical-native-scanner.js` (final trusted native calc)
   - Then proceed to `canonical-delegation-scanner.js` for delegation logic
