üß† GOAL:
Fix the canonical VSR governance power scanner (`canonical-vwr-scan.js`) to ensure:
- Accurate separation of **native** and **delegated** governance power
- No inference of delegation unless delegation relationships exist **on-chain**
- VoterWeightRecord (VWR) totals are only used for inference when delegation detection succeeds AND finds no delegations

üîç CONTEXT:
Some test wallets (e.g. `kruHL3zJ...`) currently show large VWR totals but few detected native deposits. The scanner wrongly infers delegated power instead of correctly attributing it to native power.

This happens because:
- Some deposits are **missed during parsing**
- The inference mode is **too aggressive** (triggers from any VWR vs deposits delta)

We must apply consistent rules for all wallets.

üìú REQUIREMENTS:

1. ‚úÖ **Strict Delegation Detection**:
   - A deposit is considered **delegated** only if:
     - `deposit.voterAuthority === walletAddress`
     - AND `deposit.authority !== walletAddress`

2. ‚úÖ **Strict Native Detection**:
   - A deposit is **native** if:
     - `deposit.voterAuthority === walletAddress`
     - AND `deposit.authority === walletAddress`

3. ‚úÖ **VWR Inference Mode (Only When Appropriate)**:
   - Use VWR inference **only if:**
     - Delegation scan **succeeds**
     - No actual delegation found (0 incoming deposits)
     - AND deposit scan shows **few or no owned deposits**

4. üö´ Do **not** infer delegation for wallets like `kruHL3zJ...`, where the owner has confirmed deposits with lockups + multipliers.
   - Set validation rule:
     - `kruHL3zJ`: **STRICT MODE**
     - Native: ~1,368,236.699 ISLAND
     - Delegated: 0
