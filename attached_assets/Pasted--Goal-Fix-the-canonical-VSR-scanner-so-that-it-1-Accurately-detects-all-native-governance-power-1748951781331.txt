🎯 Goal:
Fix the canonical VSR scanner so that it:
1. Accurately detects all native governance power.
2. Correctly applies VSR-based delegation rules without hardcoded exclusions.
3. Works reliably for all current and future citizen wallets.

🧭 Governance Power Rules (Canonical VSR Logic Only):

🟢 Native Power:
- Comes from deposit entries inside a `Voter` account where:
  - `voterAuthority === walletAddress`
  - Deposits are not expired (i.e., `lockup.endTs > currentTime`)
  - `amountDeposited > 0`
- Each deposit gets a multiplier: `1 + min(years_remaining, 4)` (cap at 5x)

🔵 Delegated Power:
- Comes from Voter accounts **not owned by** the wallet, where:
  - `voterAuthority === walletAddress`
  - `authority !== walletAddress` (delegator is someone else)
- Do not filter by address prefix or hardcoded address lists.
- Validate that the account is not simultaneously voter and authority.

🛠 Implementation Fix Instructions:

1. 🧪 Investigate why wallet `kruHL3zJ1Mcbdibsna5xM6yMp7PZZ4BsNTpj2UMgvZC` only shows ~30,999 native governance power.

   ✅ This wallet has **two active lockups**:
   - 310,472.9693 ISLAND
   - 126,344.82227 ISLAND

   The scanner must detect both and apply proper multipliers (est. total power > 1M, possibly ~8.7M).

2. 📦 Native Detection Fix:
   - Loop through **all depositEntries** in Voter accounts.
   - Skip entries with zero amount or expired lockups.
   - Sum: `amount * multiplier` per valid deposit.

3. 🔁 Delegation Fix:
   - For every Voter account:
     - If `voterAuthority !== wallet` → skip
     - If `authority === wallet` → skip (self-owned deposits)
   - Only include power from third-party delegators

4. ✅ Confirm:
   - `kruHL3zJ`: ~436K base deposits → native gov power >> 1M
   - `delegated` = 0

5. 🧹 Deduplication:
   - Prevent double-counting same deposits found via different byte scan methods or struct mismatches.

✅ Output Format:
{
wallet: "kruHL3zJ1Mcbdibsna5xM6yMp7PZZ4BsNTpj2UMgvZC",
native: <must exceed sum of the two deposits since they are locked with multipliers>,
delegated: 0,
note: "Detected two valid long lockups. Delegation properly excluded via canonical rule."
}

🚫 Do not use any wallet-specific filters or prefix checks. 
✅ All logic must generalize to any current or future IslandDAO citizen.
