🛠️ TASK: Final fix for the IslandDAO VSR governance power API

Please open `vsr-api-server.js` and do all of the following:

---

✅ 1. Replace getProgramAccounts filter:

Currently, you're using a memcmp filter with offset 40 to fetch only voter accounts owned by a specific wallet. This skips valid accounts. Please replace:

```js
const accounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(VSR_PROGRAM_ID, {
  filters: [
    {
      memcmp: {
        offset: 40,
        bytes: wallet,
      },
    },
  ],
});

With:

const accounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(VSR_PROGRAM_ID);

Then manually decode and filter using:

for (const { account } of accounts) {
  try {
    const decoded = program.coder.accounts.decode("voter", account.data);
    const authority = decoded.authority.toBase58();
    console.log("Decoded authority:", authority);
    if (authority === wallet) {
      // accumulate governance power from this voter account
    } else {
      console.log("⛔️ Authority does NOT match:", authority);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("❌ Failed to decode account:", err.message);
  }
}

Use the exact logic from before to calculate governance power from deposit entries.


✅ 2. Fix port usage:

Make sure the server is started with a flexible port:

const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`✅ VSR API Server running on port ${port}`);
});

✅ 3. Check for hardcoded ports:

Scan all files (especially calculate-governance-power.js, .replit, citizen-map/db-integrated-server.js, etc.) and make sure:

❌ No ports like 10000 or 3001 are hardcoded anywhere

✅ Any request to the API uses relative paths or environment-based ports

✅ 4. Preserve the following:

PostgreSQL connection and logic

Express server and middleware

NFT + Citizen Map logic

JSON output shape: { wallet, nativePower, delegatedPower, totalPower }

💡 WHY this is important:

You are currently missing voter accounts like the one belonging to wallet 3PKhzE9wuEkGPHHu2sNCvG86xNtDJduAcyBPXpE6cSNt which has multiple deposits across VSRs and >5M $ISLAND locked. By scanning everything and decoding properly, we ensure governance power is always accurate.

Once you make the changes, deploy the server and confirm logs show matched voter authorities and decoded governance power for wallets like 3PKhz....

✅ No SDK needed, no hardcoding, no skipped accounts.
