üõ†Ô∏è I need to fix the canonical VSR governance power scanner in `canonical-vwr-scan.js` to meet the following conditions without breaking any previously validated results.

üîç THE PROBLEM:
- Wallet `GJdRQcsyz49FMM4LvPqpaM2QA3yWFr8WamJ95hkwCBAh` should show ‚âà144,708 ISLAND native power (4 lockups with multipliers) but currently shows only ~5,665.
- This error was introduced after adding delegation detection logic, which incorrectly classifies this wallet‚Äôs native deposits as delegated.
- **Delegated deposits must NOT overwrite native deposits.**
- We must separate delegation and native power cleanly and ensure all multipliers and lockup conditions are preserved.

‚úÖ WHAT TO DO:
1. In `canonical-vwr-scan.js`, ensure the following parsing logic:
   - If `deposit.authority === walletPublicKey`, treat it as native governance power.
   - If `deposit.voterAuthority === walletPublicKey && deposit.authority !== walletPublicKey`, treat it as delegated governance power.
2. Lockup-based filtering:
   - Only include deposits where `lockup.kind !== none && !isLockExpired(lockup)` ‚Äì apply this logic to both native and delegated deposits.
3. Multiplier application:
   - For each valid deposit, calculate:
     ```js
     adjustedAmount = deposit.amount * getMultiplier(lockup.kind, lockup.duration);
     ```
   - Use the Registrar account to fetch correct multipliers.
4. Final values:
   - `nativePower[wallet] = sum(adjusted native deposits)`
   - `delegatedPower[wallet] = sum(adjusted delegated deposits from other authorities)`
   - `totalPower[wallet] = native + delegated`
5. Run this for each wallet in the `citizens` list and store the values in `governance_power.csv`.

üß™ VALIDATION TEST CASES (MUST PASS):
- `GJdRQcsyz49FMM4LvPqpaM2QA3yWFr8WamJ95hkwCBAh`: 144,708 native, 0 delegated
- `3PKhzE9wu...`: ~10.35M native, ~1.26M delegated
- `Fywb7YDCXxt...`: ~3.36M native, ~1.59M delegated
- `4pT6ESaMQT...`: ~12.6K native, ~4.19M delegated (from CinHb)
- `7pPJt2xo...`: ~1.7K native, ~8.7M delegated
- `Fgv1zrwB6...`: 200,000 native
- `kruHL3zJ1M...`: ~30,999 native, ~1.33M delegated

üìå Ensure these wallets report correct native/delegated values without breaking any lockup logic. Only on-chain VSR data must be used. Do not rely on VoterWeightRecords for totals. Run `validate-test-cases.js` afterward and confirm all test cases pass.

Let me know in comments where you made changes so I can track them clearly.
